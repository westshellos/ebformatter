# üêìüçúebformatter
ebformatter is a tool that optimizes the formatting of blog posts. it has more specifically been designed around [TheSmartLocal](https://thesmartlocal.com/)'s content format and managing system. 

with ebformatter, uploading articles becomes faster and more efficient as it minimizes repetitive actions and reduces proofreading times. 

writers at TSL can:
- configure all outbound links to open in new tab in one click
- ensure that headers are bolded and wrapped with horizontal lines where needed
- (wip) have listicle entries be numbered in order automatically
