# üêìüçúebformatter
ebformatter is a tool that optimizes the formatting of blog posts. it has more specifically been designed around [TheSmartLocal](https://thesmartlocal.com/)'s content format and managing system. 

with ebformatter, uploading articles becomes faster and more efficient as it minimizes repetitive actions and reduces proofreading times. 

writers at TSL can:
- configure all outbound links to open in new tab in one click
- ensure that headers are bolded and wrapped with horizontal lines where needed
- (wip) have listicle entries be numbered in order automatically

the guide below is written for writers with no experience with code.

## usage
<i> <u>note</u>: the formatter removes some spaces between paragraphs, so i recommend using the formatter BEFORE you add photos to your post so that you can add the spaces as you edit later. </i>

   <u>1.1</u> open the post you would like to format on wordpress.

   <u>1.3</u> switch the tab to "text" and select the entire post, then copy the contents. 
   
   <u>1.4</u> create a new .txt file anywhere on your file explorer and name it however you choose. <b> make sure you remember the location and name of this file. </b>
   
   <u>1.5</u> paste the contents that you copied in step 1.3 into the .txt file.
